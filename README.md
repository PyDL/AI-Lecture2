# SWATNET School 1: Introduction to Space Weather
# AI Lecture 2

This is a jupyter notebook designed for the AI Lecture 2 of the SWATNET School 1 in Novmember 2021 (https://swatnet.eu/school-1-introduction-to-space-weather/). 

It will help you to get familiar with some basic coding skills to build a machine learning model to solve space weather problems using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Any question? Contact me via j.liu@qub.ac.uk.

## Requirements

You need to install Jupyter-notebook or VSCode to open this document. To be able to run codes in this document, you need to have a working Python3 environment. The easiest and most common option is to install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) to allow you to run Python in different platforms.

You will also need to install some neccessary Python packages including pandas, openpyxl, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn. For example, if you have Anaconda installed, run the following code in your terminal to install them to your base Python environment:

    $ source activate root

    $ conda install pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, openpyxl, matplotlib

If you don't have Anaconda and prefer to messing your operation system, you may use pip to install the above packages (**not recommended for starters**).
